# Project Name

> Capstone Project - Inspired in Patashule website

![screenshot](./assets/screenshot.png)

In this project, I have cloned [this](https://www.behance.net/gallery/25563385/PatashuleKE/) Patashule website by using RWD concept. I have implemented HTML5 and CSS, making proper use of semantic tags in the HTML and Grid and Flexbox layout in the CSS.

## Instructions

There are only 3 main sections that actually respond to user interaction. Please note the following:

- index.html is the main page of the website containing a search bar and a brief description of the service/website
- The search button in the index.html header will take you to a Search Results Page (search-results.html)
- Once in the Search Results Page, you can click on any images from the results and will take you to the description of the location selected.
